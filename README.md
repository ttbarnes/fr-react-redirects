# fr-react-redirects

Redirect old netlify URLs to the live urls.

This is required due to migration. Originally, the live site had redirects for all music pages, to a new v2 react version of the music pages.

Now, all pages are in react. These redirects ensure that if anyone lands on an old react version page, they'll be redirected to the live version.
